# keyspeaker
A Qt5 frontend for espeak-ng

Once the dependencies are installed it can be run by simply typing:

./keyspeaker.py

On a Debian/Ubuntu system you can install the dependencies with:

sudo apt install python3 python3-pyqt5 espeak-ng espeak-ng-data 

and optionally any mbrola voices you'd like to use:

E.g.,

sudo apt install mbrola-en1

It's loosley based on gespeaker (https://github.com/muflone/gespeaker) which AFAIK is no longer maintained. I haven't implemented all of the functions it has though.
